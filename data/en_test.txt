said Alice.
it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
said the Pigeon.
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.
`What a pity it wouldn't stay!'
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
Silence all round, if you please!
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'
`It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
`Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his history,' As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'
cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.
`That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, `It was a treacle-well.'
said Alice; `I must be shutting up like a telescope.'
It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.
So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.
`No,' said the Caterpillar.
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.
`I've forgotten the words.'
However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
`You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
Suppress him!
Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'
`You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.
said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.
sh!'
`Explain yourself!'
There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
`Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to partners--' `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.
I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another!
How brave they'll all think me at home!
said the Queen.
Only I don't think,' Alice went on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!'
(As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.
`I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move one place on.'
`Call it what you like,' said the Cat.
`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!'
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT' engraved upon it.
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
said her sister; `Why, what a long sleep you've had!'
`Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.
said the Lory hastily.
Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!'
It's HIM.'
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
`Exactly so,' said Alice.
`I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'
So they got thrown out to sea.
`I'm a--I'm a--' `Well!
`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet!
`If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the matter worse.
`Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!'
`It's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.
"I'll be judge, I'll be jury," Said cunning old Fury: "I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."'
`I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
So she began again: `Ou est ma chatte?'
said the Mock Turtle.
Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
`How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?'
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said `That's very curious.'
Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'
shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
`Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
`The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places-- ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
Poor Alice!
`Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
`Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: `he's perfectly idiotic!'
`I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
`Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the words have got altered.'
`Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you know what "it" means.'
he replied.
For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
`Can you play croquet?'
was heard in the distance.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.
`But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I am now?
`I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
The Hatter was the first to break the silence.
CHAPTER V Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
`You did!'
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.
and read out from his book, `Rule Forty-two.
She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
`Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.
`It all came different!'
In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'
Pat!
The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--' `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?'
`It's a pun!'
said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
`Oh, you foolish Alice!'
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!'
`And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, `he won't do a thing I ask!
The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, `From the Queen.
thought Alice.
she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, `--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
Therefore I'm mad.'
Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
`What sort of people live about here?'
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: `But I don't understand.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; `and now for the garden!'
`Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?'
`Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.
(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
Visit either you like: they're both mad.'
said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
Go on!'
`I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!'
However, he consented to go on.
the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
`It's no use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at least one of them.'
Oh my dear paws!
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.
`Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!
`I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
`Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.
Now you know.'
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said `Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'
`Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, `are done with a whiting.
`Why not?'
For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!
said the Caterpillar.
`I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!'
`Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.
But she did not venture to say it out loud.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
Prizes!'
She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
`I beg pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
`It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
`It's no business of MINE.'
`Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: `it begins "I passed by his garden."'
she thought.
`There's no such thing!'
`I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so I can't take more.'
It's by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!'
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together.
it exclaimed.
You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
`I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth!
You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.'
`You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, `and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
`Why, you don't even know what they're about!'
`Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
said the Footman.
`You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you executed.'
`I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!'
`Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.
`What for?'
`Mary Ann!
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
`--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.
`What is his sorrow?'
`Oh!
`You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.
At last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'
And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.
`Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'
`Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!'
and he went on in these words: `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--' `I never said I didn't!'
`Herald, read the accusation!'
`Who are YOU?'
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
`Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
Where are you?'
`Very much indeed,' said Alice.
`No, indeed,' said Alice.
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
However, `jury-men' would have done just as well.
`Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.
she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?'
`Mine is a long and a sad tale!'
I vote the young lady tells us a story.'
While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
`And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!
No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!
`I can see you're trying to invent something!'
`I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
`As if I would talk on such a subject!
CHAPTER III A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.'
`We can do without lobsters, you know.
said the Lory.
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!'
`Read them,' said the King.
the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.
Pig!'
`Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
`I can hardly breathe.'
the Rabbit asked.
`That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
`I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
they cried out when they saw Alice coming.
`Idiot!'
`The idea of having the sentence first!'
`No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the queerest thing about it.'
`You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'
I wish you would have this cat removed!'
At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:-- `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)-- `and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' (Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'
said the Duchess.
but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
`What CAN all that green stuff be?'
she was up to her chin in salt water.
that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.
`I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but those serpents!
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.
Would the fall NEVER come to an end!
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some `unimportant.'
I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'
`But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!
Alice sighed wearily.
cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
How puzzling all these changes are!
This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
`We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--' `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be so proud as all that.'
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
`Wouldn't it really?'
And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.
This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.
here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'
`There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.
She pitied him deeply.
`Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'
`I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because I'm not myself, you see.'
`What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, `was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
There was no `One, two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream.
The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.
He got behind Alice as he spoke.
`The Queen will hear you!
said Alice.
I must have been changed for Mabel!
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.
the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.
quite a chorus of voices asked.
the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child, `for I never was so small as this before, never!
said a timid voice at her side.
`Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
`A knot!'
`There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!'
`Why?'
`Who are YOU?'
thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'
thought Alice.
I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
So she went in search of her hedgehog.
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'
`Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.
`They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'
`Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
`Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said Alice.
cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
`I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!
No accounting for tastes!
(Dinah was the cat.)
(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
she repeated, aloud.
said the others.
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.
`Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?'
He was an old crab, HE was.'
She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.
`That WAS a narrow escape!'
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,' thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
shouted Alice.
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.
I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; `but a grin without a cat!
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.
`Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
`Turn a somersault in the sea!'
`I wonder what they'll do next!
`I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
`Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
said Alice.
and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas!
`Shan't,' said the cook.
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
`I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
`Ah!
`I must be growing small again.'
I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'
He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.
Alice was thoroughly puzzled.
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
the master says you're to go down the chimney!'
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
`Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'
`I beg your pardon!'
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'
cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
`We indeed!'
There was certainly too much of it in the air.
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion.
Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.
The next witness was the Duchess's cook.
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-- `I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!'
She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
